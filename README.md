# Binary Prediction of Smoker Status using Bio-Signals

Dive into the world of binary detection with my Kaggle competition project. Equipped with 22 features, the task is to accurately classify individuals as smokers or non-smokers. The notebook meticulously navigates through data understanding, analysis, and preprocessing before deploying models. Leveraging advanced feature engineering techniques like data transformation, scaling, and K-fold, the XGBoost and LightGBM classifiers deliver impressive results, achieving ROC AUC scores of 0.8719 and 0.8725, respectively. Witness a comprehensive journey from raw data to insightful analysis in this competitive exploration of smoking detection.
